impossible stuff day

goals:
- deploy a web server that can use websockets on fly.io
- first steps: install and use mummy, try to run the examples there
- stretch goal: each client has a ping button and sees ping request of other connected clients. pings are random emojis? maybe emoji is set on first connection?
