## two clients that talk to a backend

- client
- backend + state

initial demo:
- shared counter
- use websocket
  - mist on backend
  - js ffi in client

minimal:
- start with this on client side https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket
- have mist working with this
- only later use lustre

even before websocket:
- mist hello world
